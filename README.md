# python-easy-profile
Easy to use profiler libraries for Python (most being pure-python and allowing line-by-line CPU and memory profiling, or with a GUI).

This is mostly a set of scripts containing decorators to easily interface with other libraries I did not make, such as pprofile, memory_profiler and runsnakerun.

This library was initially made for private profiling on one project, but finally I reused them for lots of other projects, thus I figured out they are pretty generic and could be useful for others.

To install this library, simply copy all the files into a subfolder of your project (you may call it "profilers" or any other name you want), and just import the profiler you want.

More usage information will maybe be provided in this readme in the future (when I've got some spare time).

The libraries were made on 2010-09-06, but they are still working as of 2015-03-16.
